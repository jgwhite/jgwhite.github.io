title: 'Code Club: Week 5'
---

[De Beauvoir Primary][dbp] is about 400 metres from [Studio 100][studio100],
where I work. Last week, I decided to capitalise upon this proximity by
running an extra lunchtime session on Wednesday. I honestly think this
is one of the best decisions I’ve made so far running the club. Instead
of the usual twelve students I got four; two of whom are usually a bit
quieter in the after school club.

We used the time to finish off fruit machine, one of the more challenging
projects from Code Club Term One. In spending a little longer working with
each student, it became clear that at least one has developed a true
intuition for the mechanics of programming in Scratch. Working rapidly
through the step-by-step instructions and jumping head first into the
unaided exercises at the end.

I’m not sure how, but we managed to squeeze almost an hour out of the
lunchtime session. I was elated at the progress I’d seen, and enthused
for the next day’s club.

Fish Chomp is one of my favourite of the code club projects. The
gameplay is simple and fun, it encourages students to record their own
sounds, and it leaves plenty of room for adaptation. Added to all that
good stuff, it also incorporates something close to a [Random Walk][random]
algorithm for the runaway lobsters.

From personal experience, learning about algorithms like this is a real
eye-opener. They’re simple, unpredictable, and produce almost life-like
results. Things get even better when you discover algorithms to simulate
2D and then 3D physics.

While these sorts of algorithm’s tend to make sense quite quickly, I’ve
noticed some of the students have taken a while to get used to the idea
of context. Code and variables relate to a particular sprite, and you
need to make sure you click on that sprite—that you’re in its context—
to be sure you’re editing the right stuff. But then some code and
variables relate to the stage as a whole, so then you need to make sure
you’re in the stage context. And sometimes it’s not clear who the code
should belong to, so then what?

My own grasp of “context” in programs is something I’ve developed over
the years through trial and error. Furthermore, it differs from
environment to environment and language to language.
Sometimes context is characterised by what `this` or `self` mean at
any given moment, sometimes it’s more implicit than that.

The students are getting a grip on it now though, and it’s another example of
a programming concept learned early and naturally thanks to Code Club.

I should briefly mention this year’s superb
[Scottish Ruby Conference][scotruby]. The line up of speakers
and atmosphere was just brilliant. So brilliant, in fact, that I
got up the courage to deliver a little lightning talk on Code Club.

The slides are below, though they won’t make a whole lot of sense
without the video. [Watch all the lightning talks right here][scotruby-videos].
