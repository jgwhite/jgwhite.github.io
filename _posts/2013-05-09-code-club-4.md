![Dear Code Club, we’re gonna need more stickers][stickers]

I thought it might be useful to give a sense of the routine of running
a club, at least for me so far.

For anybody reading this who’s thinking of volunteering, hopefully
this will give you a sense of how relaxed and easy going it is to run
an after school club.

I get to De Beauvoir Primary at 3:30pm or just before, say hi to the
folks at reception, grab my name badge and head in to find
[Rebecca Stacey][rebecca-stacey]. She’s club supervisor and the school’s
deputy head (in that order or priority, of course) and can usually be found
either in the main office or out in the playground marshalling the kids
before their parents pick them up.

We head up to the ICT room on the forth floor of the school building,
talking through the day’s club, the direction of Code Club in general, and
other technology initiative the school is planning. I’m continually amazed
by switched-on De Beauvoir is, technologically. It certainly makes my job
easier.

When we get to the ICT room, usually half the kids have beaten us there
and the other half arrive over the next five minutes or so. They’ve
normally grabbed a computer already, and we have to make sure they’re
logged in to the correct workspace, so their files save correctly.

To kick the club off, I’ll present the day’s project on the big whiteboard
with the kids sat on the floor in front. I’ll explain the machanics of the
game, have a go at playing it myself then let a couple of the kids and
everyone gets a laugh as they inevitably make my score look pathetic.

This is a nice moment to ask the kids generally how they’re feeling about
the club. Is it too hard? Too easy? Are they happy working with Scratch?
Is there anything else they’d be interested to try out?

Then it’s off to the computers. So far, I’ve been finding we’re about fifteen
minutes in by this point. I’m beginning to think we need to get started on
the work more promptly, but the slow starts have helped establish a rapport.
